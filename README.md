# Advent of Code 2025

I have but one challenge...

I will be keeping everything branchless :)

Oh. And no AI ofcourse <3

## Erm.. this is not branchless, there are still `cmp`'s!

You're so right and such a good boy for noticing. I would argue these are pretty useless to optimize for. I care more that the business logic is branchless. If you really want to spend your night replacing `rem_euclid` with a branchless version then feel free!

I'm also not looking to replace `input.lines()` since this will just become hard to read. Maybe after AOC is over thought :) I'm sure it's do-able.
